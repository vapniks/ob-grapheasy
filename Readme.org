org-babel support for evaluating Graph::Easy graph descriptions, and printing the results
into an org file as ascii or unicode diagrams, or any other format supported by the graph-easy binary.

For information on Graph::Easy see http://bloodgate.com/perl/graph/manual/index.html

This differs from most standard languages in that

 1) there is no such thing as a "session" in Graph::Easy

 2) the following extra header arguments are allowed: "outfile", "infmt", "outfmt" & "renderer" 

 3) you must have the graph-easy perl script installed

* Installation

To make sure you have the most up-to-date version of this library it is best to install 
using the emacs package system, with the appropriate repository added (e.g https://melpa.org/)

To install without using a package manager:

 - Put the library in a directory in the emacs load path, like ~/.emacs.d/
 - Customize the `org-babel-load-languages' so that it includes (grapheasy . t) in the list:
    M-x customize-variable org-babel-load-languages

* Customizable Options

 Below is a list of customizable options:

   - *org-babel-default-outfmt* :
    Default output format for grapheasy source code blocks.\\
    default value: =boxart=
